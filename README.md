# Runge-Kutta
### A fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) differential equation solver using Python

#### Only requirements to run this script are any version of Python 3.X and pip

#### Necessary libraries are in requirements.txt. Check if you have them and their proper versions before you proceed so that you do not uninstall and reinstall something that you already have.

#### All scripts should be ran in some form of a command prompt. 

#### Ignore the quotes around the line to type in to command prompt.

##### If you have all of the required libraries:

###### For the generic RungeKutta4 solver, enter: 'python RungeKutta.py' and follow the prompted tasks for entering your problem

###### For the specifically solved problem, enter: 'python RungeKuttaExample.py' and let the program guide you through the problem

##### If you do not have the required libraries:

###### Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to automatically install all the libraries

###### For the generic RungeKutta4 solver, enter: 'python RungeKutta.py' and follow the prompted tasks for entering your problem

###### For the specifically solved problem, enter: 'python RungeKuttaExample.py' and let the program guide you through the problem

##### If there are any errors, please contact me or create an issues request and I will try to solve it

##### Specifically made for my differential equations course at UConn (shoutout Christopher H.)
