# Runge-Kutta
#### A fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) differential equation solver using Python

###### Only requirement to run this script is NumPy and any version of Python 3.X

###### To use script, simply run the script and follow the prompted pop ups to compute the Runge-Kunta

###### If there are any errors, please contact me or create an issues request and I will try to solve it

###### Specifically made for my differential equations course at UConn (shoutout Christopher H.)
