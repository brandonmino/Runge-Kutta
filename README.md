# Runge-Kutta
###  A fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) differential equation solver using Python

<ul>
  
<li><h4> Only requirements to run this script are any version of Python 3.X and pip package installer</li></h4>

<li><h4> Necessary libraries are in requirements.txt. Check if you have them and their proper versions before you proceed so that you do not uninstall and reinstall something that you already have. If you are not sure, I recommend you act as if you don't have them installed just as a backup</li></h4>

<li><h4> All scripts should be ran in some form of a command prompt. </li></h4>

<li><h4> Ignore the quotes around the line to type in to command prompt. </li></h4>

<ul>
  
<li><h5> If you have all of the required libraries: </h5></li>

<blockquote><h6> For the generic RungeKutta4 solver, enter: 'python RungeKutta.py' and follow the prompted tasks for entering your problem </br></br> For the specifically solved problem, enter: 'python RungeKuttaExample.py' and let the program guide you through the problem </blockquote></h6>

</ul>

<li><h5> If you do not have the required libraries: </li></h5>

<blockquote><h6> Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to automatically install all the libraries </br></br> For the generic RungeKutta4 solver, enter: 'python RungeKutta.py' and follow the prompted tasks for entering your problem </br></br> For the specifically solved problem, enter: 'python RungeKuttaExample.py' and let the program guide you through the problem </h6></blockquote>
